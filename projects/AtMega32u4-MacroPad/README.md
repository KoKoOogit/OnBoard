# AtMega32u4 Macro Pad

The Macro Pad with AtMega32u4. 

**Features:**
- 15 1u Keys
- OLED Support
- Rotary Encoder For Volume Control
- USB-C

*Total Cost: USD 99.54*

*I order the PCB from JLCPCB & the components from LCSC. The reason for that is that I want to learn SMD soldering.*


**There are two images for carts (componenets_cart.png & cart.png) since I order PCB & componenets in multiple vendors.**
